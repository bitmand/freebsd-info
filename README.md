# FreeBSD Information

Machine readable information about FreeBSD releases.

The `freebsd.json` file contains all data and is updated automatically when data is added/changes: <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bitmand/freebsd-info/main/freebsd.json>

Most other files is just plain `txt` with very simple data, like `freebsd-releases` is a list of FreeBSD versions.

Data is updated daily.
